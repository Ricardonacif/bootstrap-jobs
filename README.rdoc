== Jobs Bootstrap

A simple Rails 3.2 app that demostrates the use of Devise with Omniauth where a user can signin using twitter or Facebook, create, read, update and delete a new job opportunity. It also demonstrates an implementation of Twitter Bootstrap 2 on a Rails app and it has some little specs using RSpec.

It was developed when I was improving my coding skill, and I wanted to share it. 

Hope you like it :D
